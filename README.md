#BlueAcorn Custom Shipping Method
This is a simple custom shipping method in Magento that communicates with an external rating source via HTTP, which
returns a rate that is the weight of the order (for each item, the weight of the item x the quantity of items) x 10.

The HTTP Client is a Zend_Http_Client located in BlueAcorn_Shipping_Model_Carrier, and the HTTP Server is a simple Node
application located in /shippingCarrierServer.js.
